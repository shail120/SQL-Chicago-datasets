# SQL-Chicago-datasets


Understand three Chicago datasets
Load the three datasets into three tables in a Db2 database
Execute SQL queries to answer assignment questions

To complete the assignment problems in this notebook I am using three datasets that are available on the city of Chicago's Data Portal:
  Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago
  Chicago Public Schools
  Chicago Crime Data
  
1. Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago
This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012.
2. Chicago Public Schools
This dataset shows all school level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year. This dataset is provided by the city of Chicago's Data Portal.
3. Chicago Crime Data
This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days.
